- **Configuration Management**: Create functionalities to manage system configurations dynamically through API calls.
- **Database Interactions**: Implement features for executing and managing SQL queries and database operations.
- **API Integration**: Design and develop RESTful APIs for communication with external systems and services.

#### 2. Determine Feature Set
- **User Interface**: Define the requirements for both GUI and CLI, focusing on user experience and ease of use.
- **Security Features**: Outline the necessary security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
- **Performance and Scalability**: Plan for handling high volumes of requests and scaling the system in various environments.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Identify how MainOp will integrate with other systems and external APIs.

#### 3. Establish Goals and Milestones
- **Short-Term Goals**:
  - Complete the initial setup and basic configuration of the Core-Layer.
  - Implement a basic version of the Admin-Listener and API routes.
- **Mid-Term Goals**:
  - Develop a fully functional Database Interaction module.
  - Complete the integration of the Core-Layer with front-end interfaces.
- **Long-Term Goals**:
  - Achieve full system integration including all planned features.
  - Ensure system scalability and robustness in cloud and on-premise environments.

#### 4. Define Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability and Uptime**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Maintainability and Documentation**: Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and comprehensive documentation.
- **Compliance and Standards**: Adhere to relevant standards and regulations for software development and data handling.

#### 5. Create a Feature Roadmap
- Develop a roadmap outlining the planned features and modules, along with their expected timeframes for development and deployment.

#### 6. Review and Finalize
- Conduct a thorough review of the project scope to ensure all critical areas are covered.
- Finalize the scope document and get sign-off from key stakeholders (if applicable).

Completion of this task will result in a well-defined project scope for MainOp, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of development. It will include a detailed list of functionalities, a feature set, and a timeline of goals and milestones, guiding the project's progression in a structured and focused manner.

### Task 1.2: Set Up Development Environment

Establish a robust and efficient development environment tailored for building MainOp with Next.js. This environment will support all necessary technologies and tools for full-stack JavaScript development.


#### 1. Install Core Software
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure the latest stable version of Node.js is installed along with npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with Node.js.
- **Git**: Install Git for version control.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Recommended IDE for its extensive support for JavaScript and Next.js development.

#### 2. Initialize Next.js Project
- Run `npx create-next-app@latest mainop` in the terminal to create a new Next.js project named 'mainop'.
- Navigate into the project directory `cd mainop`.

#### 3. Set Up Version Control
- Initialize a Git repository in the project directory using `git init`.
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and other non-essential files from version control.

#### 4. Configure IDE
- **VS Code Extensions**: Install essential extensions like ESLint for linting, Prettier for code formatting, and the Next.js extension pack.
- **Code Linting and Formatting**: Set up ESLint and Prettier in the project for consistent coding standards.

#### 5. Additional Tooling
- **TypeScript**: Consider setting up TypeScript for type-safe coding by running `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node`.
- **Environment Variables**: Set up `.env.local` for managing environment variables.

#### 6. Front-End Tooling
- **CSS Frameworks**: Install a CSS framework (like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) as needed for UI development.
- **Component Libraries**: Optionally, include component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to speed up UI development.

#### 7. Back-End and API Development
- **API Mocking Tools**: Tools like Postman or Insomnia for testing API endpoints.
- **Database Client**: If using a database, install the appropriate client or GUI (e.g., pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, MongoDB Compass for MongoDB).

#### 8. Source Control and Collaboration
- Create a repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and push the initial codebase.
- Set up branch policies as necessary for feature branching and code reviews.

#### 9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Consider setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline using platforms like Vercel, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD, especially for automated deployment and testing.

#### 10. Testing Frameworks
- Install and configure testing frameworks like Jest for unit testing and React Testing Library for UI testing.



At the end of this task, you will have a fully configured development environment ready for building MainOp with Next.js. This environment will include all the necessary tools and configurations for both front-end and back-end development, streamlined for efficiency and best practices in a JavaScript-centric stack.
