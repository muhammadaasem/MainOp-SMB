# MainOp Development Plan

## Overview
This development plan outlines the steps and strategies for building MainOp, a CMMS system, as a solo developer utilizing Next.js and ChatGPT-4 as a coding assistant.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning
### Task 1.1: Define Project Scope
The primary objective of this task is to establish a clear and concise scope for the MainOp project. This includes identifying the key functionalities, features, and goals that the Core-Layer of MainOp should achieve.
#### 1. Identify Core Functionalities
- **Admin-Listener**: Develop a component for initial setup and user interactions, including system logs and status updates.
- **Configuration Management**: Create functionalities to manage system configurations dynamically through API calls.
- **Database Interactions**: Implement features for executing and managing SQL queries and database operations.
- **API Integration**: Design and develop RESTful APIs for communication with external systems and services.

#### 2. Determine Feature Set
- **User Interface**: Define the requirements for both GUI and CLI, focusing on user experience and ease of use.
- **Security Features**: Outline the necessary security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
- **Performance and Scalability**: Plan for handling high volumes of requests and scaling the system in various environments.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Identify how MainOp will integrate with other systems and external APIs.

#### 3. Establish Goals and Milestones
- **Short-Term Goals**:
  - Complete the initial setup and basic configuration of the Core-Layer.
  - Implement a basic version of the Admin-Listener and API routes.
- **Mid-Term Goals**:
  - Develop a fully functional Database Interaction module.
  - Complete the integration of the Core-Layer with front-end interfaces.
- **Long-Term Goals**:
  - Achieve full system integration including all planned features.
  - Ensure system scalability and robustness in cloud and on-premise environments.

#### 4. Define Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability and Uptime**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Maintainability and Documentation**: Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and comprehensive documentation.
- **Compliance and Standards**: Adhere to relevant standards and regulations for software development and data handling.

#### 5. Create a Feature Roadmap
- Develop a roadmap outlining the planned features and modules, along with their expected timeframes for development and deployment.

#### 6. Review and Finalize
- Conduct a thorough review of the project scope to ensure all critical areas are covered.
- Finalize the scope document and get sign-off from key stakeholders (if applicable).

Completion of this task will result in a well-defined project scope for MainOp, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of development. It will include a detailed list of functionalities, a feature set, and a timeline of goals and milestones, guiding the project's progression in a structured and focused manner.

### Task 1.2: Set Up Development Environment
- Initialize a Next.js project.
- Configure essential tools (e.g., Git, IDE, Node.js).

### Task 1.3: Plan Development Sprints

- Implement unit and integration tests for the back-end and front-end.
- Utilize testing frameworks like Jest.

### Task 4.2: Document the System
- Create comprehensive documentation for the API and system usage.
- Document setup procedures and configurations.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Initial Feedback

### Task 5.1: Deploy the Application
- Set up a deployment pipeline (consider Vercel or similar services).
- Deploy the initial version of MainOp.

### Task 5.2: Gather Feedback
- Test the system in a real-world scenario.
- Collect feedback for improvements.

## Phase 6: Iteration and Enhancement

### Task 6.1: Analyze Feedback
- Review feedback and identify areas for improvement.
- Plan iterations based on the feedback.

### Task 6.2: Iterative Development
- Implement changes and enhancements in subsequent sprints.
- Continuously test and update the system.

## Conclusion
